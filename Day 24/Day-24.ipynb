    "We can open up text files in Python using the open function. The open function is inbuilt into Python and takes 2 main arguments: the file name and the mode. The mode can be either read or write. If we want to read a file, we use the mode 'r'. If we want to write to a file, we use the mode 'w'. If we want to append to a file, we use the mode 'a'. If we want to read and write to a file, we use the mode 'r+'. By default it opens in read mode.\n"
