    "\n",
    "We send emails using the smtplib module which is inbuilt omto Python. After importing we create a new smtp object with the location of our email provider's SMTP server. For example, for gmail it's smtp.gmail.com. We also have to specify the port number. For gmail it's 587.\n",
    "\n",
    "After creating the object we use the starttls method to encrypt our connection with our server. We then login to our email account using the login method. We give our username and password as arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "After logging in we use the sendmail method to send our email. We give the sender's email address, the recipient's email address and the message as arguments. The message is a string that contains the subject, the body of the email and the email headers.\n",

    "After sending the email we must use the close method to close the connection with the server.\n"
