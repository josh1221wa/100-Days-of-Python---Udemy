    "Functions are used to do certain functionalities or tasks for which they have been defined. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a lot of built in functions. Most common we know is print() which is used to print some text to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we look at a function we can see that its like <function_name>(). Now in print() if we put some text in the parantheses we can see that it gets printed onto the console. All functions work pretty much the same way. We call the function and put some value in the (). So because of () we know it's a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Making our own functions\n",
    "\n",
    "We start out using a keyword \"def\". And then we give the function name. After that we use a : so that every line below it that is indented is under the function. "
